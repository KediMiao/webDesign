User Interface Design 

1. Hierarchy 

Like: Color 

2. Layout 

30 - 60 characters per line, which means 34 characters and 6 words per line.

3. Alignment

Always Remember: REDUCE the alignment points.

4. White Space

Give some space for more important things, make your stuff more expensive.

5. Audience
